# Welcome

You just learned tons of new technical stuff, and now you’re equipped with the skills to make you a junior developer. This next track will guide you through the process that will end with a job offer. Know that it will be really hard, and that’s why we have set up this track like a roadmap to prepare you for what’s to come. We know what it takes to get a developer job because we’ve done this with over 600 students over the past three years. That’s why we’ve set up the [Terms of Service](https://learn.co/tos) (also referred to as “TOS”) the way we did. If you stick to what we recommend you do in the TOS, you’ll be set up to get a job. 

We’ll take you through units that cover every aspect of the job search, including:

- Writing resume and cover letters
- Creating your professional brand, including Linkedin profile, Twitter, Github, and blog
- Networking
- Preparing for interviews (both technical and non-technical)
- Communication best practices (via email, phone, and in-person)
- Managing job offers


Everyone works at a different pace. There is no right or wrong amount of time to spend with this content. Don't rush through it - everything you will work on in this track will impact your job search in some way. Similar to coding, jobseeking is a skill that takes time to learn and practice. Refer back to different lessons in this track throughout your job search process. 

In addition to this content, you will be working with an individual career coach, a well as, the entire Career Services team. Your coach will set goals with you, hold you to those goals, and will work with you for the next six months, or until you have a job offer.
