# Welcome

You just learned tons of new technical stuff, and now you’re equipped with the skills to make you a junior developer. This next track will guide you through the process that will end with a job offer. Know that it will be really hard, and that’s why we have set up this track like a roadmap to prepare you for what’s to come. We know what it takes to get a developer job because we’ve done this with over 600 students over the past three years. That’s why we’ve set up the [Terms of Service](https://learn.co/tos) (also referred to as “TOS”) the way we did. If you stick to what we recommend you do in the TOS, you’ll be set up to get a job. 

We’ll take you through units that cover every aspect of the job search, including:

- Writing resume and cover letters
- Creating your professional brand, including Linkedin profile, Twitter, Github, and blog
- Networking
- Preparing for interviews (both technical and non-technical)
- Communication best practices (via email, phone, and in-person)
- Managing job offers

These lessons are meant to be tactical and actionable, and in some cases at the end of a lesson there will be an assignment for you to complete and submit. Make sure you don’t miss any of these.

Wherever you need to submit an assignment, you will be emailing them to your coach. You'll be assigned a coach once you're through ~75% of the full stack web development track so if you don't have a coach now, just keep learning to code and we'll get you set up with one when we feel you're ready to focus on career preparation in addition to technical curriculum. Once you have a coach, you can start submitting assignments


In the subject line of your email, always follow the format “”Your name” + “Assignment Title”” In almost all cases, we’ll ask that you submit assignments through Google Docs. If you don’t have Google Drive set up, first go to drive.google.com and follow instructions from there. In the body of your email submissions, you’ll also include the following:

>Your Name

>Assignment Title

>Your City, State

>Url link to this specific google doc. 

The title of each Google Doc assignment you submitted should also always be “”Your name” + “Assignment Title””.  

Your coach will set goals with you, hold you to those goals, and will work with you for the next six months, or until you have a job. 

Everyone works at a different pace. There is no right or wrong amount of time to spend with this content. Don't rush through it and be thoughtful about the assignments. Everything you will work on in this track will impact your job search in some way. 

Similar to coding, jobseeking is a skill that takes time to learn and practice. Refer back to different lessons in this track throughout your job search process.
